                Welcome to macl2thf!
                ===================

This is the generic README file for all macl2thf distributions, so your downloaded
package may only contain a subset of what is described here.

This software was developed and tested using Racket (v5.0.1).

macl2thf_dist     (if present) folder containing a redistributable version of the tool
                  does not need Racket installed to run (N.B.: the tool needs the file
                  ck.thf to run, you can either package the one provided or create
                  your own)

macl2thf.scm      source code of the tool

                Usage
                =====

Once the tool is compiled it can be run with the following command:

    macl2thf input-file > output-file

where input-file is a properly written file according to the grammar in
grammar.bnf (see examples) and output-file is the translation ready to be fed to a
THF compliant theorem prover.
